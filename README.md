# Advanced Algorithms and Applications

This repository contains various advanced algorithm implementations and applications. Each project is designed to solve a specific problem using a unique algorithmic approach. The key projects include shortest path finding using A* algorithm, genetic analysis for CVPR, and locating objects using the Markov hidden algorithm.

## Repository Structure

- **ShortestPath/**: Contains the solution and report for the shortest path problem.
- **WhereisCrocs/**: Includes utility functions for finding objects (e.g., Crocs) on a map using the Markov hidden algorithm.
- **CVPR_GA_clean.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook for CVPR with a genetic analysis algorithm.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Shortest Path Problem
The `ShortestPath` directory contains finding Shortest Path with A* Algorithm and a detailed report for solving the shortest path problem. a popular pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm. It is used to find the shortest path between two points in a graph.

### 2. WhereisCrocs
The `WhereisCrocs` directory includes utility functions for locating objects (like Crocs) on a map using the Hidden Markov Model. This algorithm is used to predict the most likely sequence of states that results in the observed events.

### 3. CVPR with Genetic Analysis Algorithm
The `CVPR_GA_clean.ipynb` notebook implements a genetic analysis algorithm for solving problems related to Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR). The genetic algorithm is used for optimizing solutions by mimicking the process of natural selection.
